# Mykolyk -- Fang Chen, Brianna Tieu, Pepe, Cat
## Connect 4 Life
### Description
* Our project is a version of the classic game Connect 4! The game both a single player and multiplayer version. In both versions, players get to pick the respective symbols they wish to be represented by on the board. After the selection, the player can proceed to single player mode, where they will face off against the bot, Mykolyk, ten-time Connect 4 champion. After each of the player's turns, the board is automatically displayed and updated with Mykolyk's most recent play. In multiplayer version, it is assumed that thinkers will switch control of the machine. Again, both players will be able to pick their own symbols and take turns placing pieces across the board. The game ends in both versions once the maximum amount of turns have passed or once there has been a winner.
